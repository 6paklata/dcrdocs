The very first thing you will need to do to get started with Decred is create your wallet. Your wallet is like a bank account. It can contain many address and like your bank account you don't want to give anyone else access to it. An address is like a sub account. If you want to receive DCR from someone else, you give them an address that is linked to your wallet. You can either reuse the same address or create one address for each transaction or anything in between. Your wallet can generate as many address as you want.
There are three parts to getting started with Decred:

* Connecting to the Decred network by starting a node.
* Creating your wallet and attaching it to the node.
* Controlling your wallet and performing transactions.

Once you're setup and online there are three ways you can add DCR to your account.

* Purchase from an exchange
* Proof of work mining
* Proof of stake mining
